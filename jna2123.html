            <h1>About Me.</h1><br>
            My name is Joi. I am a designer, developer, and dreamer. <br>
            I do not put any limits on my work. The bigger, the better.<br> 
            My favorite color is black to design with. Pink is cool too.<br> 
            My goal is to help people make their ideas become a reality. <br>
            <br> 
            I currently reside in NYC, where I go to school â€” Columbia. <br>
            I study Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship. <br>
            One day I am going to start my own business here in NY.<br>
            <br> 
            I'd like to think that my motto is: Pray, Code, Hustle, Repeat. <br>
            <br>
            Have you heard Travis Scott's new album by the way?<br>
